## Some project ideas that our team is considering include interactive maps of traffic patterns around San Marcos and the hill country, including determining current traffic issues, showing them on maps and offering innovative solutions to these issues. Other ideas that have been discussed include having a smaller scale area to study such as the Texas State campus and providing more efficient and informative parking maps to help students navigate the current parking situation.
