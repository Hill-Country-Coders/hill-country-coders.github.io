##The purpose of our project is to provide an interactive mapping experience for Bobcats to find their ideal bar. It is important for Texas State students to have a positive experience at the Square. Our website helps fellow Bobcats find an ideal experience at the Square. Our website informs the user to different options available around the Square and helps them choose a bar that is right for them.
